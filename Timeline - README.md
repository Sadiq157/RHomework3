# RHomework3

- 24/02/21 - 

Started the homework. Loaded the data in and tidied it up.

- Evening of 24/02/21 - 

Linear model fitted

- 26/02/21 -

Loaded in Spotify data and tidied it up. Attempted PCA.
Questionable results - could be wrong(?)


- 27/02/21 - 

Grammatical checks. Fixed rMarkdown output so it doesn't show 
absolutely everything.

Turns out spotify question was wrong. Scrapped it all. Imported
the data we were meant to use and flushed out all irrelevant variables.
Then, I ran the PCA which looks a lot more promising.
Ready to submit(?)

Made sure everything made sense. Added a little bit more code
which I felt was necassary. Made sure I answered every question explicitly.

Did not want to lose marks to read_csv errors, so I made it
easier to read by shortening the lenght of the code
