```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
stroop <- read_csv("stroop_standing_data.csv")
```

The data in it's current form is *very* messy. 

```{r}
stroop <- mutate(stroop, rt = as.numeric(rt))
stroop <- filter(stroop, rt > 0)
```

We start by mutating reaction to a numerical value, not a categorical value.
By doing so, we can now omit all data where RT was not recorded (rt = FALSE)

```{r}
stroop <- filter(stroop, phase != "practice")
```

Then, we omit all practice trials.

```{r}
stroop <- filter(stroop, correct < 2)
```

Next, we omit all mistrials (correct = 999).

```{r}
stroop <- mutate(stroop, X11 = as.numeric(X11))
stroop <- stroop[,-11]
```

Finally, by changing the X11 to numeric (from logical) we can see that it is simply a copy of RT.
We can proceed by omitting the whole column as it is unnecassary. We now have uncluttered, understandable data.
